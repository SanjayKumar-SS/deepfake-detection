# **Detection of Deepfake Media**

This application detects deepfake content in uploaded videos by extracting frames and analyzing them using a pre-trained deep learning model, **MesoNet**, specifically designed for deepfake detection.

## **About**

The **Detection of Deepfake Media** is designed to verify video authenticity by detecting manipulated video content using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging the power of the MesoNet architecture, this project provides an intuitive interface that allows users to upload videos for real-time analysis. The system processes frames from each video, predicting whether they are genuine or deepfakes, along with a confidence score.

## **Features**

- **Video Upload:** Users can upload MP4 videos for deepfake detection.
- **Frame-by-Frame Analysis:** Each frame of the video is analyzed individually for accurate detection.
- **Confidence Score:** The system provides a confidence score for each frame, showing the likelihood of it being a deepfake.
- **Detailed Results:** The results include a comprehensive breakdown of real and fake frames.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple design for easy navigation and interaction, accessible to non-technical users.
  
## **Development Requirements**

- **Operating System:** Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10, macOS, or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
- **Development Environment:** Python 3.10 or later is required for the implementation of the Detection of Deepfake Media.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** Tensorflow is used for training and implementing the MesoNet model.
- **Image Processing Libraries:** OpenCV is essential for extracting and processing video frames.
- **Version Control:** Git for collaborative development and version control.
- **IDE:** VSCode or PyCharm is recommended for coding and debugging.
- **Additional Dependencies:** Includes NumPy, Scikit-learn, Django, Pillow, and Matplotlib.

## **System Architecture**

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for the user interface.
- **Backend:** Django for handling requests and integrating the detection model.
- **Model:** MesoNet model fine-tuned on the CelebDF dataset, trained to identify deepfake videos.
- **Database:** A Local storage system for uploaded videos and analysis results.

## MesoNet Model

The application leverages the **MesoNet** model, a specialized deep learning architecture for detecting deepfake content by analyzing mesoscopic features of images. 

- **Efficient Detection**: MesoNet uses shallow convolutional layers to capture subtle artifacts introduced by deepfake generation techniques.
- **Variants**: The model comes in two forms, Meso-4 (lightweight) and MesoInception-4 (with inception modules for multi-scale feature extraction). In this application, we use a pre-trained version optimized for deepfake detection.
- **Frame Evaluation**: Each extracted frame is passed through the MesoNet model, and the system generates confidence scores indicating the likelihood of deepfake content.
